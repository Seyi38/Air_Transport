### ANALYSIS OF US FLIGHT DATA FOR H1 2019


#### PROJECT OVERVIEW

A client would like to develop a model that predicts the taxi-out time for an aircraft 2 hours before the scheduled departure time. The client believes that being able to predict the taxi out time will guide them on how to fuel their aircrafts and save money by efficient use of fuel. Before the model is developed, the client would like to get answers to some questions asked by external stakeholders based on US flight data for the first half of 2019.

The aim of this anlysis is to provide answers to the following questions asked by the external stakeholders.

1. Airline with the max number of flights in Q1
2. Total Airline travels in the first half of 2019
3. Total AirTime by all Airlines in May 2019(in Hours)
4. Busiest city in April 2019 
5. Airline that covered the most distance in june
6. Aircraft that covered the most distance in quarter 2
7. State with the most delays in quarter 2
8. Daily average Taxi-out time in New York in February 2019
9. Airlines with New York destinations that were diverted in Q1 2019
10. Most rampant Delay in Washington in the first half of 2019
